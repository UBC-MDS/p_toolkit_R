# CONTRIBUTING

### Method of adding changes

Changes will be added via branching:

* Create a new branch with a descriptive name, followed by _ and initials, (for example: contributing_AG).
* Make all changes in this branch, and commit and push your changes.  
* When the branch is ready to merge, raise the merge as an issue, tagging the other two contributors.
* Once this issue is raised STOP working in this branch until the issue is resolved.
* Either of the other contributors has full authority to merge changes.
* When a branch is merged in with the Master, that branch should be immediately deleted.

### Raising Issues

Please raise an issue for any and all things!  As a courtesy, please tag all of the contributors.
