#'p_toolkit is a package designed to help adjust and visualize p-values when using multiple comparisons.
#'As computing power has become powerful enough to run hundreds or even thousands of statistical tests,
#'it is important to look at small p-values and try to understand whether the result is small simply by chance,
#'or whether it truly is significant.
